WhatsNew automatically displays a short description of the new features when users update your app. This is similar to what happens in Apple's apps like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, iMovie and TestFlight.
Simply list your new features (with optional icons), customize the appeareance and when to show it (only on major updates for example).
